# How to Build a Modern, SEO-Optimized Developer Portfolio with Next.js and MDX

A developer portfolio is more than just a collection of your projects—it's your digital identity, your resume, and your personal brand all in one. In today's competitive tech landscape, having a portfolio that is both visually appealing and optimized for search engines (SEO) can make a significant difference in attracting recruiters, clients, and collaborators.

In this article, you'll learn how to build a modern, SEO-optimized developer portfolio using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). We'll cover everything from project structure and content strategy to technical SEO and performance best practices.

## Why Next.js and MDX?

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and excellent performance out of the box. **MDX** allows you to write JSX in Markdown, making it easy to create rich, interactive content for your blog or project pages.

Combining these technologies gives you:

- **Blazing fast performance** (great for SEO and user experience)
- **Flexible content authoring** with Markdown and React components
- **Built-in SEO features** like dynamic meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data
- **Easy deployment** to platforms like Vercel or Netlify

## 1. Structuring Your Portfolio for SEO

A well-structured portfolio helps both users and search engines navigate your content. Here’s how to organize your site:

### Recommended Structure

```
/
|-- pages/
|   |-- index.tsx         # Home page
|   |-- about.tsx         # About you
|   |-- projects/         # Project case studies
|   |-- blog/             # Blog articles
|-- components/           # Reusable UI components
|-- public/               # Static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
|-- src/content/          # MDX content (posts, projects)
```

### Key Pages

- **Home:** Brief intro, featured projects, and links to blog/about.
- **About:** Your background, skills, and contact info.
- **Projects:** Detailed case studies with images, tech stack, and outcomes.
- **Blog:** Technical articles, tutorials, and thought leadership.

## 2. Writing SEO-Friendly Content with MDX

MDX lets you combine Markdown simplicity with React power. For SEO, focus on:

- **Clear, descriptive titles** (use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
- **Keyword-rich summaries** (but avoid keyword stuffing)
- **Internal links** to related projects or posts
- **Alt text** for all images
- **Structured data** (JSON-LD for articles/projects)

**Example MDX Frontmatter:**

```mdx

## 3. Technical SEO Best Practices

### Meta Tags

Use Next.js’s `<Head>` component to set dynamic meta tags for each page:

```tsx
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function ProjectPage({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{title} | Your Name</title>
        <meta name="description" content={description} />
        <meta property="og:title" content={title} />
        <meta property="og:description" content={description} />
        {/* Add more Open Graph/Twitter tags as needed */}
      </Head>
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Sitemap and Robots.txt

Generate a sitemap.xml and robots.txt to help search engines crawl your site. Use packages like `next-sitemap` for automation.

### Structured Data

Add JSON-LD structured data for articles and projects to enhance search result appearance:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Building a REST API with Django",
  "author": "Ngaikam Alex",
  "datePublished": "2025-09-10",
  "image": "/images/posts/django-rest-api.webp"
}
```

## 4. Performance Optimization

Site speed is a ranking factor for SEO. Next.js helps with:

- **Image Optimization:** Use `next/image` for responsive, lazy-loaded images.
- **Code Splitting:** Automatic with Next.js for faster initial loads.
- **Static Generation:** Use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for static content.
- **Caching:** Leverage CDN and HTTP caching headers.

**Example:**

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/images/projects/portfolio-cover.webp"
  alt="Screenshot of my portfolio"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  priority
/>
```

## 5. Accessibility and UX

Accessible sites rank better and reach more users. Ensure:

- Proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Descriptive link text

---

## 6. Content Ideas to Boost Your Portfolio SEO

- **Case studies:** Deep dives into your best projects, including challenges and results.
- **Technical tutorials:** Share your expertise on frameworks, tools, or languages.
- **Career advice:** Write about your journey, tips for interviews, or remote work.
- **Open source contributions:** Document your involvement and impact.

---

## 7. Promoting and Tracking Your Portfolio

- **Share on social media** (Twitter, LinkedIn, Dev.to)
- **Engage in developer communities** (Reddit, Hashnode, GitHub)
- **Add Google Analytics** or Plausible for traffic insights
- **Collect testimonials** from clients or colleagues

---

## Conclusion

A modern, SEO-optimized developer portfolio built with Next.js and MDX can set you apart in the tech industry. By focusing on structure, content quality, technical SEO, and performance, you’ll create a site that not only looks great but also ranks well and attracts the right opportunities.
